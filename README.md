## 1. Weak 1 Code Challenge
This is a JavaScript coding project. It is for students like myself to practice their JavaScript skills . 
This Readme file provides the procedure to code 3 folders (*chaiCalculate*, *bodaFareCalculator*,*mobileMoneyEstimator*).
Each of this folder have there own file(*chai.js*, *fee.js*, *fare.js*).
Inorder to access this files in the brower, i created HTML files for each .js files and linked them using the script in the html files.
